  NAMBA is dedicated to providing and preserving trails and the environment at Twin Peaks Bike Park. Riding on wet trails causes erosion, which damages both the trails and the environment, leading to costly maintenance and trail closures. Remember, "Wet trails are closed trails." While NAMBA will endeavor to update trail statuses on Trailforks, there may be times where our volunteer trail reporters are unable to provide the latest update. In these situations, we ask that you please use your own judgment: if you encounter mud, leave ruts, or get muddy, please turn around (and feel free to update conditions on Trailforks!). Your cooperation helps us maintain the trails for everyone's enjoyment.

      please use your own judgment: if you encounter mud, leave ruts, or get muddy, please turn around (and feel free to

    <h3>Why Avoid Riding Wet Trails?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Peserving the Trails:</strong> Wet trails are more susceptible to damage, and riding on them can lead to erosion, ruts and other damage to the trails.
        By steering clear of wet conditions, you help us maintain the integrity of the trails, ensuring they remain in prime
        condition for all riders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Costly Repairs:</strong> Repairing damaged trails is not only time-consuming but also costly. Your cooperation in avoiding wet trails directly
        contributes to the sustainability of our bike park, allowing us to invest in new features and improvements rather than
        constant repairs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Wet trail riding contributes to soil erosion, disrupting the delicate balance of the ecosystem around us. By adhering to
        our policy, you play a crucial role in preserving the natural beauty of the Niseko Area.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Dangerous Conditions:</strong> Riding in the wet can get slippery, making it easy to lose traction and crash causing injury to yourself, and damage to
      your bike. Protect yourself, and our trails, from damage!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Check Trail Conditions:</strong> Before hitting the trails, check our website to get the latest updates on trail conditions. Our volunteer trail
        reporters endeavor to provide real-time information to ensure you have a smooth and enjoyable ride.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spread the Word:</strong> Encourage fellow riders to follow the "No Riding on Wet Trails" policy. The more people who understand the importance of
        this rule, the better we can protect our trails.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Respect Trail Closures:</strong> If trails are closed due to wet conditions, please respect these closures. It's not just about your safety; it's also
        about the longevity of the trails.
      </li>
    </ol>
