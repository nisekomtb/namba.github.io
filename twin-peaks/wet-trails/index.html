      At Twin Peaks Bike Park, we're passionate about providing an unparalleled mountain biking experience amidst the
      breathtaking landscapes of the Niseko Area. Our trails are carefully crafted to deliver the perfect blend of challenge
      and exhilaration. To ensure everyone can enjoy the trails for years to come, we kindly ask all riders to respect our "No
      Riding on Wet Trails" policy.

    <h3>Why Avoid Riding Wet Trails?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Peserving the Trails:</strong> Wet trails are more susceptible to damage, and riding on them can lead to erosion. By steering
        clear of wet conditions, you help us maintain the integrity of the trails, ensuring they remain in prime condition for
        all riders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Costly Repairs:</strong> Repairing damaged trails is not only time-consuming but also costly. Your cooperation in avoiding wet
        trails directly contributes to the sustainability of our bike park, allowing us to invest in new features and
        improvements rather than constant repairs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Wet trail riding contributes to soil erosion, disrupting the delicate balance of the ecosystem
        around us. By adhering to our policy, you play a crucial role in preserving the natural beauty of the Niseko Area.
      </li>
      <li>
        When entering a trail, merging, or starting off, check your surroundings to avoid other users.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Check Trail Conditions:</strong> Before hitting the trails, check our website or contact us to get the latest updates on trail
        conditions. We'll provide real-time information to ensure you have a smooth and enjoyable ride.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spread the Word:</strong> Encourage fellow riders to follow the "No Riding on Wet Trails" policy. The more people who understand
        the importance of this rule, the better we can protect our trails.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Respect Trail Closures:</strong> If certain trails are closed due to wet conditions, please respect these closures. It's not just
        about your safety; it's also about the longevity of the trails.
      </li>
