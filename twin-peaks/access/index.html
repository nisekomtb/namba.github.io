    <h3>Trail Access</h3>
    <p>Please follow these access instructions to ensure a smooth and respectful experience while visiting the park.</p>
    <h4>Entry Point:</h4>
    <p>Entry to the bike park is behind a Japanese shrine, called the Yamada Jinja. This is a beautiful traditional shrine, and a chance to experience Japanese culture – it is not part of the trails, and should be treated with utmost respect.</p>
    <p>To ensure the mountain bike community retains a lasting, strong relationship with the Yamada Jinja Shrine Committee, we
          enforce the below rules when entering or exiting this area:</p>
    <h4>Access Path:</h4>
    <p>A gravel access path has been built directly adjacent to the torii gate and the sando (the gravel path which leads
    directly to the shrine). This is traditionally a path to the gods – as such it is not a path to our trails. Please treat
    this area with respect.</p>
    <p>⚠️ Bikers are strictly prohibited from riding through the torii gate, and from using the sando to enter or exit the trail
          network.</p>
    <p>⚠️ Instead, <strong>bikers must use the gravel access path located adjacent to the sando</strong>.</p>
    <h4>Crossing the Sando:</h4>
    <p>When entering or exiting the trail network and crossing the sando, please follow the steps below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Dismount your bike – <em>do not ride between the shrine and the tori gate</em> as this is immensely disrespectful to the shrine,
      and to the culture.</li>
      <li>Walk your bike – walk your bike across the short distance of the sando.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following these steps, we can maintain the sanctity of the shrine area, show respect to the culture, and coexist with
    the shrine.</p>
    <h4>Enjoy the Twin Peaks Bike Park:</h4>
    <p>Once you have crossed the sando, you are free to enjoy the bike park to its fullest extent.</p>
    <p>Please adhere to all park rules and regulations for your safety and the safety of others.</p>
