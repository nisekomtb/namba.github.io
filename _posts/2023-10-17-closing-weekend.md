Autumn has arrived, and as the leaves change so too do the seasons. With Niseko soon to be blanketed with snow, the time has now come for us to close the trails for the year.To celebrate an amazing season, we're hosting a closing weekend celebration, and all are invited to join in on the fun!

We have a host of events lined up for the closing weekend:

### Strava Segment Challenge: <small>(weather permitting)</small>

<span class="cancelled">⛈️ Cancelled due to weather ⛈️</span>

What's a Strava Segment Challenge?

Strava is a GPS app that allows us to run a self timed, semi-virtual race right here in the Twin Peaks Bike Park! On the day, we'll let you know the specific “Segment” (or trail section) of our trails to race on. Your time will be recorded using a GPS device or your smartphone. The fastest riders will be featured on our leaderboard, and with prizes up for grabs make sure to bring your A-game!

The competition is open to all riders (excluding NAMBA crew), and there will be categories for men, women, boys and girls!

Participation is easy:

1. Download the Strava app on to your GPS device (phone, smart watch, etc)
1. Record your ride on Strava, and set the privacy as “public”
1. Share your achievements and see how you stack up against fellow riders.

### NAMBA Open House Event:
In addition to all of the action happening out on the trails, NAMBA is also hosting an Open House Event – we’ll be meeting with members of the media and government to provide more information about Twin Peaks and about NAMBA’s vision for the Niseko area.

This event is open to the public, and it’ll be happening just down the road from the trailhead at Midtown Niseko. It's an excellent opportunity to learn more about NAMBA to get a glimpse of the future of mountain biking in our region!

Don't miss out on this fantastic weekend of biking, fun, and community at Twin Peaks Bike Park. We can't wait to celebrate with you as we close the season in style. Mark your calendars and get ready for a memorable day!
