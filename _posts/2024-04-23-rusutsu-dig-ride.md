Join the Yotei MTB Club for their first course maintenance and riding session of the season at the Rusutsu Flow Trail! This year, we're kicking things off early thanks to an unusually warm spring, so come help us prep the trail for a fantastic riding season.

### Event details

With the snow already cleared from the trails, we're ready to dig in! We will focus on maintaining the trail to ensure it's in perfect condition for riding. After we've tidied up the trail, we’ll celebrate with some riding time. It's a great opportunity to give back to the trail and then enjoy the fruit of our labor.

### What to Bring

- Maintenance tools (shovels preferred; the club has a limited number of spares, so bring your own if possible)
- Your bike and helmet for riding after maintenance

### Weather Consideration

The event will proceed even with light rain, so dress accordingly.

### Note
The timing is loose; feel free to join later or leave earlier as needed. This event falls outside of Golden Week, a consideration for those concerned about availability.

Come dig, ride, and enjoy the camaraderie of fellow biking enthusiasts. Let’s make this season's first ride one to remember!
