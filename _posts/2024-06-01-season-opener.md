Get ready for an unforgettable start to the summer with the Niseko Area Mountain Bike Association (NAMBA) at the Twin Peaks Bike Park opening weekend! This marks our first full summer of operation, and we have an action-packed schedule to celebrate the occasion.

### The Dirty Dames - Women Only Group Ride: <small>(weather permitting)</small>

Don’t miss the debut of our "Dirty Dames" women's group ride, a special event that was postponed last year. Gather for a friendly meet-up with coffee at Rhythm, followed by the ride from 10 AM to 11 AM.

It's an opportunity to connect with fellow female riders, share your passion for biking, and explore the trails together in a supportive and fun environment. All skill levels are welcome, from beginners to seasoned pros.

### Strava Contest Launch:

This weekend also sees the launch of our season-long Strava competition. With categories for both King of the Mountain (KOM) and Queen of the Mountain (QOM) across various age groups, set your sights on ending the season as a champion. Winners will be announced as the season wraps up; you have all season to improve your times.

What's a Strava Segment Challenge?

Strava is a GPS app that allows us to run a self timed, semi-virtual race right here in the Twin Peaks Bike Park! On the day, we'll let you know the specific “Segment” (or trail section) of our trails to race on. Your time will be recorded using a GPS device or your smartphone. The fastest riders will be featured on our leader board, and with prizes up for grabs make sure to bring your A-game!

The competition is open to all riders (excluding NAMBA crew) and participation is easy:

1. Download the Strava app on to your GPS device (phone, smart watch, etc)
1. Record your ride on Strava, and set the privacy as “public”
1. Share your achievements and see how you stack up against fellow riders.
