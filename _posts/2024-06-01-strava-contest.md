### What’s a Strava Segment Challenge?

Strava is a popular GPS tracking app that enables cyclists to participate in a self-timed, semi-virtual race. During this contest, participants will compete on a designated "Segment" – the <a href="https://strava.app.link/j7NjKd0TYJb" target="_blank">lower section of the Easy Ryder</a> trail. Your times will be recorded using any GPS-enabled device, and you'll need to set your Strava privacy settings to "public" to participate. Aim to climb the leaderboards by improving your time throughout the season!

### Competition Details:

- <strong>Eligibility</strong>: The competition is open to all riders except for NAMBA staff and members of the affiliated trail team.
- <strong>How to Participate</strong>:
  - Download the Strava app onto your GPS device (smartphone, smartwatch, etc.).
  - Record your rides on the Easy Ryder trail segment.
  - Make sure your ride data is set to public on Strava to ensure your times are eligible for the competition.
