<h3 style="margin-top:0;" id="about-namba">About NAMBA:</h3>

The Niseko Area Mountain Bike Association (NAMBA) is Japan's premier trails organization and the leading advocate for mountain biking in the Niseko area. Established in 2021 by local mountain biking enthusiasts, NAMBA is dedicated to enhancing the mountain biking infrastructure and promoting the sport in the region – <em>and having a damn good time while doing it!</em>

In 2022, NAMBA achieved significant milestones, including official nonprofit status in Japan and the groundbreaking of the Twin Peaks Bike Park in partnership with Allegra. The park, located in Hirafu, offers free access to approximately 30 kilometers of interconnected trails suitable for riders of all ages and skill levels.

2023 marked the Grand Opening of the Twin Peaks Bike Park, featuring ~9.5km of trails, and strengthened partnerships with local resorts, stakeholders, and leading mountain bike brands. By the end of the building season, NAMBA had completed over 14 kilometers of trails within the park.

2024 saw further growth, with an additional ~4.8km of trails added in Twin Peaks and ~1.5km in Grand Hirafu, progressing towards the long-term goal of connecting the two bike parks.

Building on this success, 2025 promises further expansion of the Twin Peaks Bike Park and other exciting plans, making it an exciting time to join NAMBA and contribute to our vision for the area.
