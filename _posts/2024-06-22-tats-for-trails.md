## Get Inked to Support Trail Building in Niseko

Unleash your creativity and support trail building in Niseko with the “Tats for Trails” competition, presented by NAMBA. Whether you’re dreaming of your next tattoo or simply want to contribute to a great cause, this is your chance to get involved.

### How It Works:

It's simple: just submit your tattoo idea for a chance to win!

The skilled artists at 59 Niseko are offering a **total of ¥90,000 worth of tattoo time** for the creators of the three best designs. You don’t need to be a tattoo enthusiast to participate; even if you’re not looking to get inked, your entry can still support trail development efforts.

### How to Enter:

- **Pay your entry fee:** Contribute a minimum of ¥500 to the trails per submission. 100% of all proceeds go to trail building, and entrants are encouraged to “Pay What They Want,” allowing you to donate more towards trail building if desired.
- **Submit your design idea:** Describe your tattoo idea, describing it in 20-30 words or less. Be concise but creative in expressing your vision.<br/>The theme is open, and does not have to be related to mountain biking. Creativity and originality in any theme are encouraged!
- **Follow on Instagram:** To be eligible to win, you must follow both <a href="https://instagram.com/nisekomtb" target="_blank">@nisekomtb</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/59niseko" target="_blank">@59niseko</a> on Instagram.
- **Enter again!** There is no limit on the number of entries you can submit – you can enter as many designs as you want and increase your chances of winning! Entries must be submitted separately, and each entry requires a minimum contribution of ¥500.
- **Win???** All ideas will be anonymously judged, and the top three designs will receive vouchers to help make their idea become a reality!

- **Voucher Redemption:** Prizes must be claimed at 59 Niseko. Winners need to visit the studio to redeem their tattoo time.
- **Open to Non-Locals:** While the competition is open to anyone, winners must be able to visit the studio in person to claim their prize.

### Judging:

- **Anonymous Judging:** Entries will be anonymously judged by <a href="https://www.59niseko.com/scott-wentworth" target="_blank">Scott Wentworth</a> of 59 Niseko, focusing on the artistic value and originality of each design.
