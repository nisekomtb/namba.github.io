## Pump Up The Jam: Akaigawa Pump Track's Grand Reopening

Get ready to pump up your ride! Join the excitement at Akaigawa Tomo Playpark on June 1st, 2024, as they celebrate the thrilling reopening of the Velosolutions Pump track! After several years, the park is delighted to welcome you back to this favorite spot, now featuring a revamped, asphalt pump track perfect for BMX, mountain bikes, skateboards, and kickboards.

Additionally, to celebrate the reopening, we are excited to announce a grand opening race event on the Sunday. Join them for an exhilarating competition and showcase your skills!

This event coincides with the same weekend as the Twin Peaks Bike Park opening. It's a fantastic opportunity for riders to enjoy both venues. If you're attending Twin Peaks Season Opener, consider extending your adventure by camping at Akaigawa Tomo Playpark, and enjoy the newly refurbished track right where you're staying.

The pump track has been redesigned with a smooth asphalt finish, enhancing the experience and ensuring fast, exhilarating rides. Please note that unlike in 2021, the course can no longer be lapped continuously. Riders must walk back to the starting point after reaching the finish. Remember to inform yourself of the usage instructions, complete the necessary usage agreement form, and obtain a wristband at reception, which must be worn before starting your ride.

Please note that there are no rental bikes available for the 2024 season.
