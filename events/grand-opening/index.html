          <strong>TWIN PEAKS BIKE PARK IS OPENING TO THE PUBLIC!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Join us on the trails here in Niseko on the weekend of the 16th and 17th of September where we'll have:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>An opening ceremony</li>
            <li>Demo bikes from Santa Cruz</li>
            <li>Booths from your favorite brands like ION, Reserve Wheels, Peaty's and more</li>
            <li>A chance to win giveaways and free merch</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>The event</h3>

        <p>Santa Cruz is setting up a booth at Rhythm Japan Base and bringing a fleet of demo bikes, including the Megatower, Hightower, Tallboy, Nomad, Bronson, 5010, Blur and Stigmata – this is an awesome chance to try some sick bikes here in Japan’s newest bike park!</p>

        <p>We’ll also have two UCI Mountain Bike World Series downhill racers as guest riders, Hajime Imoto and Yuki Kushima!</p>

        <p>Yuki and Hajime are accomplished riders, representing Japan and their sponsor Santa Cruz in the UCI Mountain Bike World Series. Can't wait to ride with both Yuki and Hajime, and to see the speed and style they bring to the trails here in Niseko!</p>

        <p>Thanks to Allegra who have supported NAMBA and spearheaded the design and building of this park, and thanks to our sponsors, our supporters and our community for helping us create a free and open trail network!</p>

        <h4>About NAMBA</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>Building trails and community</strong>
        </p>

        <p>NAMBA (Niseko Area Mountain Bike Association) is a registered nonprofit organization uniting the Niseko area towards the common mission of creating a world class sustainable mountain bike community, and off-road biking ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The organization is well underway on their first project, the Twin Peaks Bike Park – this is a professionally built and maintained, free-to-ride trail network located in the resort area of Niseko, Japan. Once all phases of the project are completed, the park is expected to be home to some 30 kms of trails, making it Japan’s largest community bike park.</p>
        <p>Beyond Twin Peaks, NAMBA’s masterplan for the area seeks to create an interconnected web of trails encompassing everything from beginner skills areas, to 50+ km backcountry epic trails, to lift accessed bike parks and everything in between.</p>
        <p>We invite you to register to join our nonprofit, and hope to see you out on the trails soon!</p>
