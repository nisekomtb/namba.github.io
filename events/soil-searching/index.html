        <h3>About Soil Searching</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Why not sponsor trail builders like athletes?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Specialized does. The Soil Searching is a movement to recognize, celebrate, and support the trail builders – the unsung heroes of mountain biking, building and shaping our sport.</p>
        <p>Soil Searching is proud to be supporting NAMBA’s trail builders, kitting them out with the bikes and apparel they need to dig (and ride!) the trails at the Twin Peaks Bike Park.</p>
        <p>Dig days, such as Soil Searching in Niseko, create community, impart knowledge and welcome riders of all ages and abilities to the sport. These outcomes align with NAMBA’s mission of creating, enhancing, maintaining, and protecting great places to ride in Niseko.</p>

        <h4>About NAMBA</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>Building trails and community</strong>
        </p>

        <p>NAMBA (Niseko Area Mountain Bike Association) is a registered nonprofit organization uniting the Niseko area towards the common mission of creating a world class sustainable mountain bike community, and off-road biking ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The organization is well underway on their first project, the Twin Peaks Bike Park – this is a professionally built and maintained, free-to-ride trail network located in the resort area of Niseko, Japan. Once all phases of the project are completed, the park is expected to be home to some 30 kms of trails, making it Japan’s largest community bike park.</p>
        <p>Beyond Twin Peaks, NAMBA’s masterplan for the area seeks to create an interconnected web of trails encompassing everything from beginner skills areas, to 50+ km backcountry epic trails, to lift accessed bike parks and everything in between.</p>
        <p>We invite you to register to join our nonprofit, and hope to see you out on the trails soon!</p>
